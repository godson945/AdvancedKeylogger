# Advanced Keylogger Test

## Overview

This project is an advanced keylogger built for ethical hacking and penetration testing purposes. It demonstrates how keystroke logging, microphone, and camera access can be handled with permission in modern browsers.

### Features:
- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures keystrokes and logs them for analysis.
- **Microphone Access**: Requests access to the user's microphone and can record audio (with permission).
- **Camera Access**: Requests access to the user's camera and can record video (with permission).

## Ethical Use:
This tool is intended strictly for educational purposes and testing in environments where you have explicit permission to perform penetration tests. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

### Vulnerabilities Explored:
1. **Keystroke Logging**: Potential to capture sensitive information.
2. **Microphone and Camera Access**: Can be exploited to spy on users.

### Mitigations:
1. **Input encryption**: Protect sensitive data with encryption.
2. **Permission Handling**: Always request explicit user permissions for accessing system resources.
3. **Use of HTTPS**: Ensure secure transmission of captured data.
